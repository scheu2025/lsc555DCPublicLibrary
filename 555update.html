	<h2 style="text-align:center; color:#632539;"><u>Part 1: Description of the Organization and Information System</u></h2>
<h3 style="color: #255863">DC Public Library Mission</h3>
	<p>"The District of Columbia Public Library is a vibrant center of activity for residents and visitors in the nation's capital. The library provides environments that invite reading, learning, and community discussion and equips people to learn all their lives, to embrace diversity, and to build a thriving city. We are proud to be a recognized force in the community for engaging the mind, expanding opportunities, and elevating the quality of life" (DC Public Library, 2025).</p>
<h3 style="color:#255863"><a href="https://www.dclibrary.org/about-us/dc-public-library-history">DC Public Library History</a></h3>
	<p>After being created by Congress in 1896, the District of Columbia Public Library has served the population of the District of Columbia through the years by offering books and information services for all citizens of the area.  The original branch of the DC Public Library was housed in a home on New York Avenue and housed a collection of 15,000 donated books. In 1903, the building on New York Avenue was replaced by the main library building in Mount Vernon Square, a move that was started with a donation by Andrew Carnegie (DC History Center, 2025). It was the first building in DC to be built in the Beaux Arts style (DC Historic Sites, 2025). Carnegie funded three more branch libraries in the DC Public Library system, including Takoma, Mt. Pleasant, and Southeast (Capital Hill) (DC History Center, 2025).</p>
<h3 style="color:#255863"><a href="https://www.dclibrary.org/about-us/dc-public-library-culture">DC Public Library Culture</a></h3>
	<p>The culture of the DC Public Library is guided by five principles: Give & Get Respect (is how we treat each other), Be a We (is how we work together), Invest in Us (is how we grow as an organization), Welcome Everyone (Is how we serve our customers), and Stay Rooted (is how we advocate for our communities) (DC Public Library, 2025). The values were designed to support organizational goals and performance management, build on respect, and radiate into the world.</p>  
	<p>These five principles can be seen through programs and collections at the DC Public Library. For example, the DC Public Library offers a "Beyond the Book" literacy program that supports children and those below their reading level in developing their reading skills. Children are supported in reading programs to inspire a love of reading, to build their confidence, and to create lifelong learners (DC Public Library, 2025).</p>
<p>In addition to the Beyond the Book program the DC Public Library offers an Arts and Exhibits program that highlights the history and culture of the District of Columbia through displays and exhibits throughout the library buildings and online to create a source of learning, discovery, growth and connection (DC Public Library, 2025).</p> 
<p>The People's Archive is a department within the DC Public Library that works to collect, preserve, digitize, and make accessible the history of the District of Columbia (Reyes-Gavilan et al, 2022). The People's Archive works to make collections accessible, such as the interactive permanent exhibit, Up from the People: Protest and Change in D.C., an exhibit that builds a connection between the naming of the central library and the local legacy of Martin Luther King, Jr (Reyes-Gavilan et al, 2022).</p>
<p>Adult learning is also a large push within the DC Public Library through their Adult Learning Department (ALD). This department is staffed with adult literacy education specialists. It offers adult literacy services, including GED classes, career coaching, English as a second language programming, and digital literacy (Reyes-Gavilan et al, 2022).</p>

<h3 style="color:#255863"><a href="https://www.dclibrary.org/about-us/library-services-and-technology-act">Technology Plan</a></h3>
<p>The DC Public Library Technology is based on four goals:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Recover Together: The library will strengthen existing services and develop new ones that support District recovery priorities, such as improving personal health, education, career prospects, and digital inclusion.</li>
	<li>Welcome Everyone: All residents will feel welcome in an accessible library where their needs are centered.</li>
	<li>Invest in Us: District residents will benefit from improved library services through enhanced investment in staff training and development, innovative collections, technology, and opportunities.</li>
	<li>Stay Rooted: D.C. history and culture will be celebrated through community-centered programming, exhibits, and collections.</li>
</ol>
<p>Within these goals are plans for partnering with the D.C. Office of the Chief Technology Officer (OCTO), Tech Together D.C. and the Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE) to create adult tutoring, literacy and learning, and digital literacy initiatives in addition to workforce development and entrepreneurship activities. The DC Public libraries also plan on investing in Universal Access by partnering with the Mayor's Office of Deaf, Blind and Hard of Hearing and the Office of Disability Services to provide specialized equipment and resources for patrons(Reyes-Gavilan et al, 2022).</p>
<p>Finally, the DC Library Technology Plan includes the goal of digitization and preservation of collections so that the lives of all D.C. residents are enriched through a better and more enhanced connection with their history and culture (Reyes-Gavilan et al, 2022).</p>

<h3 style="color:#255863"><a href="https://www.dclibrary.org/plan-visit/arthur-capper-techexpress">Arthur Capper TechExpress</a></h3>
<p>The Arthur Capper TechExpress is a Neighborhood Library within the DC Public Library system. It was designed as a quick stop for wi-fi access, public computers, printing, copying, and scanning items. It also offers the option of returning items and picking up holds. It is located on the second floor of the Arthur Capper Recreation Center. There is a limitation on the ability of the recreation center staff to assist patrons in DC Public Library transactions (DC Public Library, 2025).</p>
<h3 style="color:#255863"><a href="https://content.govdelivery.com/accounts/DCLIBRARY/bulletins/3d7598b">Key Upgrade Features of the New Catalog</a></h3>
<ul>
	<li>Built-in spelling corrections and related-topic suggestions will help customers find what they need, even if they are unsure of a title or author's name.</li>
	<li>The new catalog consolidates all material types of a title into a single search result, eliminating the need for multiple searches to locate different formats of the same item. </li>
	<li>Customers can place holds on physical copies with a single click and borrow eBooks or audiobooks directly through the system, reducing the need to switch between different platforms.</li>
	<li>A new notification system ensures that customers receive updates about holds, due dates, and account details via their choice of email or text message, allowing them to stay informed in a way that suits their routine.</li>


	<h2 style="text-align:center; color:#632539;"><u>Part 2: Evaluation of Existing Information System</u></h2>
<p style="text-align:center">We conducted our evaluation of DC Public Library's Online Catalog using <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/"> Nielsen's 10 Heuristics</a> (Nielsen, 2024).</p>
<ol>
	<li><b>Visibility of System Status</b></li>
<ul>
<li>DC Public Library's Online Catalog responds quickly to user actions. If the response is delayed, the user is made aware of this by a loading indicator: either a spinning circle or a progress bar.</li>
<li>There is a small delay when switching from the website results to the catalog results, but a "loading..." screen appears during the switch.</li> 
</ul>
	<li><b>Match Between the System and the Real World</b></li>
<ul>
<li>The website uses plain, easily understandable language and does not use any jargon. The search button has a magnifying glass, which makes it easily recognizable. The "get a card" button and chat button also have recognizable symbols next to them: an identification card and a chat bubble, respectively.</li>
</ul>
	<li><b>User Control and Freedom</b></li>
<ul>
<li>There is a trail of links at the top of the webpage that shows you what page you started on and allows you to get back to the pages you were previously on quickly. Pop-up screens can be closed easily.</li>
</ul>
	<li><b>Consistency and Standards</b></li>
<ul>
<li>The website uses simple, consistent language throughout, such as "Find eBooks, movies and more" and "Find locations & hours" to make it easier to navigate.</li> 
<li>The website also includes a footer on all pages with links similar to the ones in the header, but also includes Contact, About Us, Career, Policy, and How to get involved informational links.</li> 
</ul>
<img src="consistency.png" width="1543" height="204">
	<li><b>Error Prevention</b></li>
<ul>
<li>In the catalog search, a back button takes the user to the previous page in addition to the back button on the browser.</li> 
<li>The PAC also gives a "Search Results Tour" and "Resource Page Tour" button on each page, respectively. Each button gives more information about the specific page.</li>
</ul>
<img src="errorprevention.png" width="1543" height="204">
	<li><b>Recognition Rather than Recall</b></li>
<ul>
<li>The DC Public Library website uses a similar design throughout the pages, with only slight changes in colors on pages to delineate the differences in sections.</li> 
<li>The website also consistently uses the same header throughout all the pages that includes a link back to the main page, along with a link to getting a card, the patron's account, and the search.</li> 
<li>Help & Support links and Contact Us links include arrows to indicate that a patron can click on them to find more information.</li> 
</ul>
	<li><b>Flexibility and Efficiency of Use</b></li>
<ul>
<li>The website uses a header throughout the pages, including a drop-down search menu that searches the catalog, events, and the rest of the site. This makes it easier for the user to continue their research once they have finished on a specific page, or if they have a random thought they want to search.</li> 
</ul>
<img src="flexibility.png" width="1543" height="204">
	<li><b>Aesthetic and Minimalist Design</b></li>
<ul>
<li>The DC Public Library uses a website design that uses color bars throughout the page to delineate between different sections of each page.</li>
<li>Colors used on pages are attractive to the eye and complement each other.</li> 
<li>Some pages, such as the Research & Learn and the Plan a Visit page, run a little long and may lose the patron's attention before they find what they need.</li> 
Both pages have ways to narrow down sections that may be the most useful to the patron. 
</ul>
<img src="aesthetic.png" width="1543" height="204">
	<li><b>Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors</b></li>
<ul>
<li>Search results clearly show how many results the user's search retrieves, whether zero or thirteen thousand.</li> 
<li>Search also allows users to easily click between the library catalog, website, and events for searching and results.</li>
<li>Service Alerts appear as needed at the top of all pages, easily seen and read.</li> 
</ul>
<img src="servicealert.png" width="1543" height="204">
	<li><b>Help and Documentation</b></li>
<ul>
<li>At the bottom of each page is a list of the most common help needed that links to other pages with the information.</li> 
<li>On the Borrowing Materials page, there are the most common help topics in an accordion menu marked with downward arrows to show more information available.</li> 
</ul>

	<h2 style="text-align:center; color:#622457"><u>Part 3: Critical Analysis of the Organization's Information Systems and Recommendations</u></h2>
<p>The DC Public Library (DCPL) has consistently demonstrated its commitment to inclusive learning, equitable access, and civic engagement principles woven through its programs, collections, and strategic technology goals. Its website and newly upgraded catalog reflect many of these values in practice. Using human-computer interaction (HCI) frameworks and systems analysis, this section examines the effectiveness of DCPL's information systems and identifies areas for targeted improvement.</p>
<h3 style="color:#255863">Critical Analysis</h3>
<ol>
	<li><u><b>Mission Alignment and User-Centered Design:</u></b> DCPL's mission to "equip people to learn all their lives" and "welcome everyone" is well represented in the site's inclusive tone, accessible language, and rich digital services. The values of Welcome Everyone, Invest in Us, and Stay Rooted are reflected in programs like Beyond the Book, the People's Archive, and the Adult Learning Department. The website serves as the digital front door to these services, and overall, its design and content are well-aligned with the library's cultural and strategic vision. The site also allows the entire catalog to be translated into seven languages.</li>
	<li><u><b>Search and Catalog Experience:</u></b> The newly launched catalog system improves search by consolidating multiple formats into a single result and offering built-in spelling corrections and topic suggestions, enhancing usability and reducing search friction. Once a search is made, the site offers several faceted filtering options such as Author, Material, Branch Locations, etc.  However, the homepage search bar does not use auto-suggest or predictive input to assist users unsure of spelling or terminology, which could be a barrier to those with lower digital literacy or limited English proficiency.</li>
	<li><u><b>Live Chat Support-Helpful but Limited:</u></b> The live chat feature successfully connects users with real librarians during very limited operating hours (usually 10am-3pm), but it becomes unavailable outside those hours. Patrons who use the site during evenings or weekends find support unavailable when they need it most. This absence can be particularly limiting for first-time users, job seekers, or those using the system for educational purposes.</li>
	<li><u><b>Mobile and Accessibility Gaps:</u></b> The site uses a responsive layout and offers assistive features (ARIA landmarks, alt text), but certain workflows-like browsing events or navigating long pages-are still not optimized for mobile or neurodiverse users. The Research & Learn and Plan a Visit pages are content-heavy and visually dense, potentially overwhelming users who rely on screen readers or prefer chunked, minimalist layouts.</li>
</ol>
<h3 style="color:#255863">Recommendations</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Introduce an After-Hours AI Chatbot</li>
<ul>
	<li>Deploy a basic AI chatbot to assist with FAQs, account help, and catalog navigation.</li>
	<li>Train the chatbot to escalate complex issues via email or direct users to help pages.</li>
	<li>Ensure it labels itself as AI and complements (not replaces) real staff.</li>
</ul>
	<li>Redesign Key Pages for Mobile and Neurodiverse Users</li>
<ul>
	<li>Break up long content sections with subheadings and collapsible menus.</li>
</ul>
	<li>Add Feedback Loops and Page Ratings</li>
<ul>
	<li>Embed quick-response buttons (thumbs up/down or 5-star ratings) on major service pages.</li>
	<li>Use this feedback to identify which pages need revision or additional explanation.</li>
</ul>
</ol>


	<h2 style="text-align:center; color:#622457"><u>Conclusion</u></h2>
<p>An evaluation and analysis of the DC Public Library's online catalog found many strengths and some areas for improvement. The DC Public Library has a stated mission to create an accessible and inclusive library system for residents and visitors of Washington, DC. The catalogue achieves this goal by creating a user-friendly system that caters to the needs of a wide range of ages and abilities. Some of its strengths include new search features that increase its usability, a strong focus on user-centered design, and a clear intent to fulfill its mission statement. An evaluation according to Nielsen's Usability Heuristics found that the site did well at matching the real world and ensuring that system status remained visible for users. In addition, the site features a consistent page layout and large links and dropdown menus that contribute to flexibility and efficiency of use. Options to seek assistance are prevalent, and users are able to recover from errors with relative ease. The areas that could use improvement are: support chat, sections of the website that are particularly content-heavy, and a lack of predictive input within their search capabilities. While help links are prevalent, the live chat capability is limited, and is only available a few hours a day during business hours, which could prevent many users from being able to take advantage of them. In addition, it would be beneficial to consolidate content in various sections to improve clarity for users as well as increase user assistance in the search section to better prevent user errors. To address these minor issues, it would be beneficial to follow these three recommendations: 1) Introduce an After-Hours AI Chatbot; 2) Redesign Key Pages for Mobile and Neurodiverse Users; and 3) Add Feedback Loops and Page Ratings. Overall, it is clear that users are at the forefront of the design for this catalog, and while there remain a few areas in which it could use improvement, it is effective in achieving its mission to create an accessible and inclusive library system for residents and visitors of Washington, DC.</p>
